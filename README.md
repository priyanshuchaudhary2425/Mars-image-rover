# Mars Image Rover üöÄ

One of my favorite projects! While learning how to use **REST APIs**, I created this application to explore Mars.  

Using the **NASA Mars Rover API**, you can fetch images taken by Mars rovers on any given **sol (Martian day)** along with relevant details about the photo.

## Features
- Fetch Mars rover images by sol (Martian day)  
- View details like camera, rover name, and earth date  
- Built using NASA's REST API  

## Requirements
- Create a `.env` file in the project root  
- Get your **own NASA API key** from [https://api.nasa.gov/](https://api.nasa.gov/)  
- Add it to your `.env` file as:  
```

NASA\_API\_KEY=your\_api\_key\_here

````

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository and navigate into the folder:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/priyanshuchaudhary2425/Mars-image-rover.git && cd Mars-image-rover
````

2. Install dependencies (if needed):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Run the app:

```bash
python main.py
```

4. Open your browser and go to:
   [http://127.0.0.1:5000/](http://127.0.0.1:5000/)

Enter a **sol day** to see images captured by Mars rovers! ü™ê

```

I can also make a **short, 3‚Äì4 line showcase version** suitable for GitHub front page so it looks clean and professional. Do you want me to do that?
